        In this web page I introduce three fun and meaningful techniques or
        tools for learning, hyperdoc, crossword puzzle and Google Classroom. I
        have been using these tools for my instruction and have seen my teaching
        burden decreasing and student spend more time on learning.

        Hyperdoc is a document which has hyperlinks like Google doc or Google
        Slide. Students go to a hyperdoc and work on their copy of the document
        and submit their copy after completing a task assigned to them. The
        document has hyperlinks that lead students to additional pictures or
        presentations. Students can also add their own pictures in the document
        to show teacher pictures. Hyperdoc helps students more focused on
        learning and helps them have more responsibility for learning.

        Crossword puzzle is one of the vocabulary words learning tools. This
        tool seems to help students memorize and remember new vocabulary words.
        They can use flash cards to study vocabulary words. For a review
        crossword puzzle works well. It is, however, of limited use because it
        is hard for teachers to make crossword puzzles on their own. There are
        some online crossword puzzle makers but they charge. Teachers are
        reluctant to use them paying fee for it, because they don't use them
        often. If there is online crossword puzzle maker available for desktop
        and mobile for free, it would help teachers and students a lot.

        Google Classroom is a good framework that includes several tools in it.
        Assignments and presentations and sometimes quizzes are laden and
        administered in Google Classroom. Hyperdoc is used with Google Classroom
        because students open the document in Google Classroom, and submit their
        results into Google Classroom. Teacher also gives them grade in Google
        Classroom with comments. I use this tool for all my teaching subjects.
