      ></br>These templates were designed to ease teachers in to the HyperDoc
      creation process, and provide a starting point. There are five templates,
      representing different lesson design models. We love to see how unique
      each HyperDoc becomes from the template.

        >Screencasting #1</a
      ></br>This is an example of hyperdoc. The content of the hyperdoc is
      screencasting. Another effective way of instruction. We see lots of
      screencasting in our web text or Youtube through which instruction on
      coding is delivered. One more article about screencasting is linked below.</br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iysXWkTTqAYsW-puQr3gUz1SgC9xS8gBwJnBMFCtKPE/edit?usp=sharing">Screencasting #2</a>

A dissection manual and picture was linked so that students could see the names of the parts of the brain. Students  were also asked to take three pictures of the brain, view from top, view from bottom and internal structure, and to label parts of the brain. This activity seemed to help students work together to make a lab report and increase student participation.
