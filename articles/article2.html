    <article><a href="">Google Classroom</a></br>Google classroom is very commonly used in classes these days. I also use Google Classroom for my anatomy and physics classes. I use Google Classroom to post my presentation files so that students get information when they miss some points or go back to the presentation for clarification. Students who are absent from the class get a lot of help by studying the presentation content by themselves.</br>
    Google Classroom is also effective for assignments and short quizzes. I give students assignments through Google Classroom and they turn in their works into Google Classroom. It is easing teacher's burden of collecting student assignments and it is also good for students who do not make sure whether or not they turn in their homeworks. </article>
