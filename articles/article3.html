      <article>online crossword puzzle </br>
    I love to teach vocabulary words, and have tried several methods to introduce new vocabulary words to students. The so-called 6 steps method was developed especially for limited english proficient students. It requires students of saying loud about their ideas about vocabulary words and saying reasons when they match vocabulary words, their definitions and related pictures. </br> 
    Another method I used is 3 by 3 vocabulary puzzle. Each side of a card has either a vocabulary word or a definition or description. Students match a vocabulary word and its definition. When they do this correctly, they can make a 3 by 3 square. Sometimes it is challenging for a few students but most students finish this activity successfully.</br>
    What I want to do with my anatomy class is crossword puzzle. There are some crossword puzzle templates. But is it possible for students to do crossword puzzles on line which teachers make? I wonder if this is technically feasible and if students do this activity for free.
