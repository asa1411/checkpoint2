    <article class="article1"><a href="./article1.html">article 1</a> </br> <em>hyperdoc</em>  </br>Hyperdoc is a document which has hyperlinks like Google doc or Google
      Slide. Students go to a hyperdoc and work on their copy of the document
      and submit their copy after completing a task assigned to them. The
      document has hyperlinks that lead students to additional pictures or
      presentations. Students can also add their own pictures in the document
      to show teacher pictures. Hyperdoc helps students more focused on
      learning and helps them have more responsibility for learning.

      Google Classroom is a good framework that includes several tools in it.
        Assignments and presentations and sometimes quizzes are laden and
        administered in Google Classroom. Hyperdoc is used with Google Classroom
        because students open the document in Google Classroom, and submit their
        results into Google Classroom. Teacher also gives them grade in Google
        Classroom with comments. I use this tool for all my teaching subjects.

        Crossword puzzle is one of the vocabulary words learning tools. This
        tool seems to help students memorize and remember new vocabulary words.
        They can use flash cards to study vocabulary words. For a review
        crossword puzzle works well. It is, however, of limited use because it
        is hard for teachers to make crossword puzzles on their own. There are
        some online crossword puzzle makers but they charge. Teachers are
        reluctant to use them paying fee for it, because they don't use them
        often. If there is online crossword puzzle maker available for desktop
        and mobile for free, it would help teachers and students a lot.
